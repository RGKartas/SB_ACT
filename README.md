This is a Parser for the game ShadowBane !

It is still a work in progress.

Please feel free to submit your logs of Mines / Banes by emailing them to me !
The more logs I have the better and more accurate the parsing will be.

## Shadowbane setup:
	1. Make a new chat window (or repurpose an old one).
	2. Got to the windows properties icon
		a. Click Channels
		b. Select the following Channels
			Combat
				Add All Hits
				Add All Misses
				Add All Passive
				Add All Info
				Add All Error
			Powers
				Add Information
				Add All Damage
				Add All Effects
				Add All Heal
				Add All Fail
				Add All Success
				Add All Info
				Add All Error
	3. Log out to Save it
	4. Log Back in
	5. Got to the windows properties icon
		a. Click Log
		b. Type a file name in the box.
		c. Turn on the button
		d. Click (Ok)
	6. The log file will appear in the installed Shadowbane folder in the Logs directory.
		Set your ACT "Open Log" to the one you just created.

NOTE :: Shadowbane does not flush the log file quickly.  There may be a few seconds delay for information to appear.
